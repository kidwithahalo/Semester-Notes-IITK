1. Total angular momentum is given by 
   $$L_{\text{total orbit}} = \mu \sqrt{GMa ( 1 - e^2)}$$
   where 
   + $a$ = semimajor axis
   + $e$ = eccentricity of the orbit
   + $M$ = combined mass of the binary system
   + $\mu$ = reduced mass of the system

2.   Escape speed of a planet A is given by 
   $$v_{esc} = \sqrt{2G \frac{M_{A}}{R_{A}}}$$

3. Keplar's Third Law for Period of orbits is given  by 
   $$P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G(m_{1}+ m_{2})}a^3$$
