### <span  style = "color:Coral">Black Holes </span>
in the case of stellar remnants with the mass above the maximum allowed mass of a neutron star, no mechanism is yet known that can prevent the complete gravitational collapse of the object. 

In fact, general relativistic calculations predicts that even if some new form of pressure sets in at the highest densities, the gravitational field due to such pressure will overcome any support the pressure gradient provides and the collapse of the star to a singularity or black hole is unavoidable. 

A proper calculations for the blackhole requires general relativistic calculations. However  we can do some order of magnitude  calculations. 

As we all know that the black holes get so dense and gravitational pull becomes so strong that the photon can not even escape. Hence ,we can calculate the degree upto which whole mass can be compressed as given below : 
$$\frac{GM}{r} > \frac{1}{2}v_{e}^{2}= \frac{1}{2}c^2$$
and escape velocity  = speed of light 
or, 
$$r = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}= 3 \text{ km} \frac{M}{M_{\bigodot}}$$
This is called ==Schwarzschild Radius==

Note that above equation is incorrect because K.E of a photon is not $\frac{1}{2}mc^2$ and gravitational pull cannot be $\frac{GM}{r}$ for general relativistic limit. Nevertheless it gives a good estimate of a Schwarzschild radius. 

### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Interacting Binaries</span>
So far we have seen objects which are powered by nuclear reactions like normal stars. However there exists a bunch of other system which are not powered by nuclear reaction rather is powered by the accretion of matter onto gravitational potential well. 

These objects are pre-main sequence stars, interacting binaries active galactic nuclei and quasars. Also some types of supernova and gamma ray bursts. 

These all objects are really rare in comparison to the normal stars, but study of them are of great interest as they provide crucial physics and observational aspects. In all of them, accretion physics remains similar. 

Here, we will be talking about interacting binaries. These are the stars in binary with an orbital period of less than about 10 days. Their orbits is mostly circular , aligned and synchronised. 

- Aligned - the spin axis of the two stars and the orbital plane axis are all parallel. 
- Synchronised  - each star completes a single rotation about its axis once per orbit and hence each star always sees the same side of its companion star. 

These stars are mainly tidally locked and get in this situation based on action of the strong tidal force

The force pre unit mass on a mass element at the surface of a star, at a distance $\Delta r$ from the center due to the mass $M$, of the star itself is 
$$\tag{1} \frac{F_{grav}}{m} = \frac{GM_{1}}{({\Delta}r)^2}$$

The tidal force on this mass element due to the influence of the second star $M_2$ at a distance $r$ (where $\Delta r << r$)
$$\frac{F_{tide}}{m} = GM_{2} \bigg(\frac{1}{r_2} - \frac{1}{(\Delta r + r)^{2}}\bigg) \approx \frac{2GM_{2}\Delta r}{r^3}$$

Hence, the ratio of two forces, 
$$\frac{F_{tide}}{F_{grav}} = \frac{2M_2}{M_{1}} \bigg( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \bigg)^3$$

Therefore the largest $\frac{\Delta r}{r}$, the more tidal distortion of the shapes of the stars occurs, such that they become two oval pointing to each other. 

$$\Downarrow$$

As long as the stars are not tidally locked (i.e synchronised and circularised, energy is continuously lost to the friction while the different part of each star are deformed during the orbit). Once the tidal locking is achieved, everything appears stationary in a reference frame rotating at a binary frequency and the system achieved its minimum energy.
