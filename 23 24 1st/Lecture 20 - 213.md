##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen"> What is the Mohorovičić Discontinuity?</span>
The Mohorovicic Discontinuity, or "Moho," is the boundary between the crust and the mantle. The red line in the diagram shows its location.

In geology the word "discontinuity" is used for a surface at which seismic waves change velocity. One of these surfaces exists at an average depth of 8 kilometers beneath the ocean basin and at an average depth of about 32 kilometers beneath the continents. At this discontinuity, seismic waves accelerate. This surface is known as the Mohorovicic Discontinuity or often simply referred to as the "Moho."

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Earth's Crust</span>
+ Below ocean basins lies  thin oceanic crust 
	+ Made primarily of Basalt
+ Below landmass lies thick continental crust
	+ Made primarily of Granite
+ Low density of continental crust makes it possible for the continents to float over the highly dense mantle 

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Earth's Mantle</span>
+ Composed mainly of olivine-rich rock
+ Have different temperature at different depth - this steady increase in temperature with the increasing depth is called <u>geothermal gradient</u>. 
  The highest temperature is when the mantle touches the heat producing core. 
  
  The geothermal gradient is responsible for different rock behaviors. 
  Rocks in the upper layers of crust are cool and brittle while the rocks in the lower level are warm and soft (not molten).
  Rocks in the upper mantle are brittle enough to break under stress and produce earthquakes and rocks in lower mantle flow instead of breaking when subjected to stress causing the convection inside of earth. 


##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Earth's Core</span>
+ Composed mainly of iron and nickel alloy (reason is based upon the fact that many meteorites (which are thought to be portions of the interior of a planetary body) are iron-nickel alloys)
+ The core is earth's source of internal heat because it contains radioactive materials which release heat as they break down into more stable substances.
+ There are two parts to the earth's core 
	+ The outer core is a liquid because the temperatures there are adequate to melt the iron-nickel alloy with composition $\text{Fe + Ni (2\%)}$
	+ In inner core ,the pressure and temperature is extremely high to the extent that force is strong enough to crowd the atoms tightly together and prevents the liquid state. It is made majorly of $\text{Fe + Ni (20\%)}$
+ It constitutes 30% of $M_{\bigoplus}$ but only constitutes 17% of $V_{\bigoplus}$


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Reasons why Earth have so many layers ? </span>
Each layer has a unique density $$\biggr(\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}\biggr)$$Scientists believe that all planets formed on the basis of gravity. Therefore, **the layering of Earth is a result of gravitational pull**. The densest layer (inner core) is at the center and the least dense layer (crust) is the outermost layer.


### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Volcanism</span>
[Look at this video of Volcano](https://youtu.be/b9Hq6bTBF2A)

Significant outpouring through an opening on a planetary body is termed as Volcanism

Causal factors for the volcanism can be 
+ Primary Internal Heating
+ Tidal Heating - The flexing from gravity causes tidal heating. In the same way that you can heat up a spot on a wire coat hanger by repeatedly bending it, the flexing creates friction in Io's interior, which generates the tremendous heat that powers the moon's extreme volcanism
+ Tectonic Impacts

Types of Volcanic discharge can be 
+ Mud Volcanism
+ Cryovolcanism
+ Ferrovolcanism
