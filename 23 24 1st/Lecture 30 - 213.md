$$\Downarrow$$

1. The Cordilleran ice sheet repeatedly advanced to block the Clark Fork River
2. Behind the ice dam, water from the Clark Fork gathered, forming glacial  Lake Missoula
3. Each time the ice dam broke, a torrent of water with 10 times the combined flow of all the world's river barreled through the Spokane River valley.
4. The rushing floodwaters traveled southwest across the Columbian Basin, scouring the bedrock. 
5. Floodwaters converged into the Columbia River Gorge and eventually emptied into the Pacific.

    A[Repeated ice dam failures led to several cycles of flooding which deposited enormous <br> pile of sediments ] --> B[The nature of sediments depends on the source <br> transportation environment ]
    B --> C[The relatively fine scale deposits highlighted in the image indicate relatively <br> calm depositional environment which allowed fine scale sediment to deposit]

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Wind as a carrier of Dust</span>
1. Planet's radiation budget  $\Longrightarrow$ incoming and outgoing radiation
2. Dust activity 
	- Periodicity
	- Geographic scale
3. Dust may impacts in multiple ways 
	- Opacity of the atmosphere impact navigation
	- Important nutrient for life on land and in ocean
	- Serve as nuclei for cloud formation
