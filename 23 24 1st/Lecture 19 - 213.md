<hr>


+ What factors really do affect the formation of rocks - is it wind, air and other physical reasons or are there more factors to it ? 
+ Rocks bear imprints of formation environments
	+ Sequence of flat layers 
	+ Tilted stack of layers 
	+ Folded layers of rocks


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Pseudomorphism</span>
The process of replacement in which a mineral retains the outward crystal form of another mineral species
> Pseudomorphism is **the existence of a mineral that has the appearance of another mineral**. Pseudomorph means false form. Pseudomorphism occurs when a mineral is altered in such a way that its internal structure and chemical composition is changed but its external form is preserved.

They can occur by two different methods 
1. Pseudomorph by substitution - Petrified wood (Silica replaces wood fibres)
2. Pseudomorph by Encrustation - Crust of one mineral deposited over host mineral, imbibing its structure. Host mineral is dissolved and removed at a later stage. E.g. Quartz encrusted cubes of fluorite. 
3. Pseudomorph by Alteration - Partial addition of a new mineral at the cost of partial removal of host mineral. Core of original mineral may be preserved. E.g. Anhydrite $(\text{CaSO}_4)$ to Gypsum $(\text{CaSO}_{4} \cdot2H_2{O})$


> Rocks types and their formation depend on the geological settings on the earth and around the globe there are different geological features and its functioning.
> Further the internal working on the earth helps in rendering of various types of geological settings.

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Why the Earth's crust is significant ? </span>
The crust is **a thin but important zone where dry, hot rock from the deep Earth reacts with the water and oxygen of the surface, making new kinds of minerals and rocks**. It's also where plate-tectonic activity mixes and scrambles these new rocks and injects them with chemically active fluids

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Why there are such abundance of silicates on Earth's crust , covering around 92% of earth's crust ? </span>
**Because oxygen and silicon are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust**, and because the (SiO4) tetrahedron is such a stable complex, silicate minerals are extremely stable and abundant in crustal rocks and sediments.
