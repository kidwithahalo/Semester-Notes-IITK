###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">Mass Radius Relationship</span>
We can again use the scaling relations for the hydrostatic equation mass continuity. 

Hydrostatic Equilibrium $\Longrightarrow$ $$\frac{dP}{dr} \approx \frac{-GM \rho (r)}{r^2}$$
or 
$$P \sim \frac{GM \rho}{r}$$
We also know , 
$$\rho \sim \frac{M}{r^{3}} \Longrightarrow P \sim \frac{GM^2}{r^4}$$

This gives the mass radius relationship as 
$$\tag{3} r \sim \frac{b}{G} M^{\frac{-1}{3}}$$

This is an order of estimate from the stellar structure equation. 
However, if we solve full stellar structure equations then the radius of white dwarf would be 
$$r_{wd} = 2.3 \times 10^{9} em \Bigg(\frac{Z}{A}\Bigg)^{\frac{5}{3}} \Bigg(\frac{M}{M_{\bigodot}}\Bigg)^{\frac{-1}{3}}$$
and for $\frac{Z}{A} = 0.5$ and $M = 1M_{\bigodot}$ , we get $r = 4000 \text{ km}$

As we see from previous equation that larger the mass of white dwarf, the smaller the radius of white dwarf becomes  $\Longrightarrow$ larger densities and therefore larger momenta to which the electrons are pushed

When the electron velocities become comparable to the speed of light, we can no longer assume $v = \frac{p}{m}$, instead the velocity $v$  which dictates the rate at which collisions transfer momentum to the container wall, approaches to $c$.

In this ultra relativistic limit, we can replace $v$ with $c$ and the equation of the state then becomes 
$$P_{e}= \frac{1}{3} \int_{0}^{P_{f}} \frac{8 \pi}{h^{3}}\;p^2\;p\;c\;dp$$
$$ = \frac{8 \pi c}{3h^{3}} \frac{p_{f}^4}{4}$$
and also we have , recalling 
$$P = \frac{1}{3} \int_{0}^{\infty} n(p)\;p\;v\;dp$$
Hence, for ultra-relativistic degenerate spin $\frac{-1}{2}$ fermions gas, the equation of state changes to 
$$\tag{4} P_{e}= \Bigg( \frac{3}{8 \pi} \Bigg)^{1/3}{\frac{hc}{4m_{p}^{4/3}}}\Bigg( {\frac{Z}{A}}\Bigg)^{4/3}\rho^{4/3}$$
