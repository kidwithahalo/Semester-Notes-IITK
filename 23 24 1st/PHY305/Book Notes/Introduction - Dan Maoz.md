Revising, we get $\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$ and this quantity is called <span  style = "color:Sienna">Diffraction limit</span>
 + Human eyses have a fixed integration time, of about 1/30 second so it is not possible to collect light and then produce a image like in long exposure. 
   
   For some telescopes, light could be allowed to be collected for months and thence the faintest sources can be traced and optically produced. 

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">EM Wave Characterisation</span>
For a EM wave with electric filed, it can be described as 
$$E = \hat{e}E(t)\cos({2 \pi \nu t} - k \cdot r + \phi)$$
where
+ $\hat{e}$ gives the direction of polarization of the electric field
+ $E(t)$ is field’s time-dependent amplitude
+ $\nu$ is the frequency
+ $k$ is the wave vector, having the direction of the wave propagation, $|k| = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$
+ $\phi$ is the phase shift of the wave

###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">Diffraction Limit</span>
A source of light with an angular size smaller than this “diffraction limit” will produce an image that is “unresolved”. This "diffraction limit" is defined as 
$$\text{Diffraction limit = }\frac{\lambda}{D}$$
