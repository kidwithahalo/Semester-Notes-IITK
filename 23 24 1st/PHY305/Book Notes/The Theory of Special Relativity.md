## <span  style = "color:PaleGreen">The Failure of Galilean Transformation</span> 
^f03c08

###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">The Ether Question ???</span>
James Clerk Maxwell predicted that light consists of “modulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena,” <b style = "color:red">but what was the medium through which light waves traveled?</b>

Now , coming back to Galilean Transformation, we say the two observer sitting in $S$ and $S'$ reference frame will measure a single moving body and the equations of co-ordinates from these two observers are called Galilean Transformation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x' = x - ut \\
y' = y  \\
z = z' \\
t' = t \\
\end{aligned}
$$
and differentiating we get,  $$v' = v-u$$ and consequently on account of $u$ being the constant we get,  $$a' = a$$meaning that same acceleration is observed from both the reference frames as per the Galilean transformation. 
So essentially, Galilean Transformation was working only on low speed stratum of world where $v/c << 1$

The Einstein Postules can be framed like 
+ <b style = "color:red">The Principle of Relativity</b>
	The laws of physics are same in all reference intertial frame
+ <b style = "color:red">The Constancy of Speed of Light</b>
	Light moves through vacuum at a constant speed $c$ which is independent of the motion of light source.

The Lorentz factor or Lorentz term is a quantity expressing <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">how much the measurements of time, length, and other physical properties change for an object while that object is moving</span>

$$\Delta t_{moving} = \frac{\Delta t_{rest}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}}$$

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">The Proper Length and Length Contraction</span>
Similarly for the length contraction, the equation can be given as 
$$L_{moving} = L_{rest}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}}$$
![[Pasted image 20230809150918.png|20]] Only lengths or distances parallel to the direction of the relative motion are affected by length contraction; distances perpendicular to the direction of the relative motion are unchanged

## <span  style = "color:PaleGreen">Relativistic Momentum and Energy</span> 

^fcba5c

According to the Principle of Relativity, if momentum is conserved in one inertial frame of reference, then it must be conserved in all inertial frames.
Further, the definition of the relativistic momentum equation becomes
$$p = \frac{mv}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \gamma m v$$
where $\gamma$ is called Lorentz Factor 
> Mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation so it does not make much sense to define a term as 'rest mass'. Mass of a particle does not increase with increasing speed but its momentum sure approaches infinity when $v \longrightarrow c$

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">The Derivation of $E = mc^2$</span>
![[Bradley Dale.pdf]]
The second term in the above formulae is the energy that the mass have when it is a $v = 0$, or <b style = "color:RebeccaPurple">rest energy</b>
$$E_{rest} = mc^2$$
Above formulae (in pdf) gives the total energy of the particle and thus the Kinetic Energy of the particle is $\text{K.E = Total Energy - Rest Energy}$
Further, see this formula 
$$E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4$$ where 
+ $E$ = Total Energy of the system
+ $p$ = magnitude of momentum
+ $mc^2$ = rest energy
>The interesting thing is that this equation is valid for particles that have no mass i.e. photons. 

Likewise , the relativistic momentum equation becomes same $p = \gamma mv = \frac{mv}{v}$
