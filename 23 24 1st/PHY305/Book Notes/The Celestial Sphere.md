Some points to start with 

+ Stars move steadily from east to west during the course of a night
+ Planets were previously called 'wandering stars'

## <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">The Geocentric Universe</span>
Long time back, Plato  proposed that celestial bodies should move about Earth with a uniform (or constant) speed and follow a circular motion <b style = "color:red">with Earth at the center of that motion.</b> This concept of a <b style = "color:magenta">geocentric universe</b>.

### <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">The Retrograde Motion</span>
Definition of retrograde motion was taken for the wandering stars (planets). Below is the definition of same. This problem of retrograde motion was prevalent in astronomy for almost 2000 years. 
> A planet such as Mars moves slowly from west to east against the fixed background stars and then mysteriously reverses direction for a period of time before resuming its previous path

> <b style = "color:red">Wikipedia definition of same</b>
> Apparent retrograde motion is the apparent motion of a planet in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point. Direct motion or prograde motion is motion in the same direction as other bodies

+ Betelgeuse, the bright star in the constellation of Orion, is visible at 5h 55m 7 24
+ Aldebaran, in the constellation of Taurus, has co-ordinates 4h 36m 16(degree) 31(min) 
+ Hyades and Pleiades star clusters (also in Taurus) are visible at 4h24m, +15(degree) 45(min) and 3h 44m, +23(degree) 58(min)

Predictions of the Ptolemaic model did agree more closely with observations than any previously devised scheme, but the original philosophical tenets of Plato (uniform and circular motion) were significantly compromised.

### <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">The Altitude - Azimuth Coordinate System</span>
Some definitions 
+ <span  style = "color:Salmon">Zenith</span> - point on the celestial sphere directly above the observer (zenith distance is given by $z$)
+ <span  style = "color:Salmon">Altitude</span> - angle measured from the horizon to the object along a great circle (given by $h$)
+ <span  style = "color:Salmon">Azimuth</span> - measured along the horizon eastward from north to the great circle used for the measure of altitude (given by $A$)
+ $h + z = 90 \degree$

> ## Trivia
> The sinusoidal shape of the ecliptic occurs because the Northern Hemisphere alternately points toward and then away from the Sun during Earth’s annual orbit.

> ##### <b style = "color:red">Reason why sometimes days are longer and sometimes thet are not </b>
> During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun’s northern declination causes it to appear higher in the sky, producing longer days and more intense sunlight. During the winter months the <b style = "color:red">declination of the Sun</b> is below the celestial equator, its path above the horizon is shorter, and its rays are less intense (see Fig. 1.12). The more direct the Sun’s rays, the more energy per unit area strikes Earth’s surface and the higher the resulting surface temperature.

### <span  style = "color:Plum">Motion of Stars </span>
The movement of star will have a vectorial representation as 
$$ \vec{v} = v e_r + v e_{\theta} $$
where $e_r$ is the radial component 
and $e_{\theta}$ is the transverse or tangential component, along celestial sphere. 

This transverse velocity appears as a in its equatorial co-ordinates, known as  <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">proper motion</span>
(usually expressed in seconds of arc per year)

Star's proper motion $\mu$ is given by following equation and is related to its transverse velocity. 
$$\mu = \frac{d\theta}{dt} =\frac{v_{\theta}}{r} $$

### <span  style = "color:Plum">Spherical Trigonometry</span>

Spherical trigonometry is **the branch of spherical geometry that deals with the metrical relationships between the sides and angles of spherical triangles, traditionally expressed using trigonometric functions**. On the sphere, geodesics are great circles.

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Synodic  and Sidereal Period </span>

^5db9a7

###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">Synodic Periods</span>
It is the the time required for a body within the solar system, such as a planet, the Moon, or an artificial Earth satellite, to return to the same or approximately the same position relative to the Sun as seen by an observer on the Earth


###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">Sidereal Periods</span>
It is the time required for a celestial body within the solar system to complete one revolution with respect to the fixed stars—i.e., as observed from some fixed point outside the system.

Formula of the synodic and sidereal is given by 
$$ \frac{1}{S} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    \frac{1}{P}- \frac{1}{P_{\bigoplus}}:\text{(inferior)}\\
    \frac{1}{P_{\bigoplus}}- \frac{1}{P}: \text{(superior)}
  \end{array}
\right.
$$
where 
+ $P_{\bigoplus}$ is the sidereal period of the Earth = 365.25 days
+ $S$ is the synodic period
+ $P$ is the sidereal period
