### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Theory of Stellar Evolution</span>

- From HR diagram, we have seen that the star is always evolving and hence true equilibrium does not exist. 
- Nuclear reaction in the centre  synthesises the helium from the hydrogen and change the initial composition of the star. Convection is set at some radial distance. And one day, the stars will have consumed all of the hydrogen and there would be nothing the counteract the pressure against the gravitational collapse. 


###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">If there is no true equilibrium, then how do we study these stars ? </span>
We construct a series of equilibrium stellar structure model (called stellar evolution track), in which one update, as a function of age of star since the formation, the gradual enrichment by elements heavier than hydrogen at different radii of the star. $\Longrightarrow$ as we have seen the main sequence star does not change much in observed properties and make only small movements in the diagram. 

### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Main Sequence life time for the stars with different masses</span>
There is a dependency of luminosity on the mass of stars, 
$$L \sim M^{\alpha}$$
where $\alpha = \text{different for different masses of stars}$
And since nuclear energy is the only available energy, and fraction of mass will eventually be converted to the energy, which shall dictate that 
$$E \sim M \sim L t_{ms}$$
or $$t_{ms} = \frac{M}{L} = M^{1- \alpha}$$
and thus the scaling relation can be given as 
$$\bbox[8px, border: 2px solid red] {L \sim M^{3} \Longrightarrow \alpha = 3}$$
$$\bbox[8px, border: 2px solid red] {t_{ms} = M^{-2}}$$
Detailed stellar structure model confirms this result. 

<u>Thus, more massive a star, the shorter its hydrogen burning phase on the main sequence. </u>

Now, for the ease, we are listing out the main sequence life time for stars with different masses but with initial solar abundances.

Just a quick fact that our sun is about halfway through its main sequence. 

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Massive Stars</span>
If we move into a massive stars, then due to only electron scattering opacity and radiation pressure, 
$$\tag{$\alpha= 1$}L \sim M$$ 
Hence, $$t_{ms} \sim M^0$$
as we see, the value does not depend on the mass and reaches a limiting value. 

Further, for mass of star > 30 $M_{\bigodot}$, we have 
$$t_{ms} \rightarrow 3 \times 10^{6} \text{ years}$$

The lifetime of  massive stars $\sim 10^{6}- 10^{7} \text{ years}$ are short compared to the age of the sun or age of the universe. 
The fact that we observe such stars means star formation is an ongoing process in those stars. 
$$\Downarrow$$
Once most of the Hydrogen is used in the core , the core starts to contract and innermost temperature rises. As a result, hydrogen in the less processed regions outside the core starts to burn in a shell surrounding the core. 
$$\Downarrow$$
Stellar models consistently predict that at this stage, there is a huge expansion of the outer layers of the stars. 
$$\Downarrow$$
The increase in luminosity due to the gravitational contraction and hydrogen shell burning moves the star up in the H-R diagram. Also, increase in the radius lowers the effective temperature that moves the star towards right in the diagram . This is <span  style = "color:yellow">Red Giant Phase</span>

Note that the huge expansion of stars envelope is difficult to explain by means of simple and intuitive arguments but it is well understood and predicted robustly by the equation of stellar structure. 

###### <span  style = "color:Orchid">Time Span for stars in Red Giant Phase</span>
$$t_{\text{red giants }} < t_{\text{main sequence}}$$
For solar mass stars $\longrightarrow 10^9\text{ years}$ 
For stars mass $\sim 10 M_{\bigodot} \sim \text{order of million years}$
For massive stars $\sim 10^{5} \text{  years }$

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Triple - Alpha Reaction</span>
![[Screenshot 2023-10-17 at 3.35.12 PM.png]]
Triple alpha is the only reaction that can produce elements heavier than the helium in the presence of only hydrogen and helium, because no stable elements exists with atomic mass numbers of 5 or 8. The Beryllium isotope $\ce{^{8}_{}Be}$ formed from the fusion of two $\ce{^{4}_{}He}$ nuceli has the lifetime of $\text{10 ns}$

$$\Downarrow$$
Horizontal branch evolution last only about 1% of the main sequence lifetime. 
$$\Downarrow$$
Once the helium in core has been exhausted, the core (now composed of carbon and oxygen) contracts again, until a surrounding shell of helium starts to ignite with a hydrogen burning shell around it. During this brief ($\sim 10^{7}\text{ years}$) double shell burning stage , the star ascends the asymptotic giant branch of the H-R diagram - essentially a repeat of the red-giant branch evolution, but with helium + hydrogen shell burning around an inert carbon/oxygen core, rather than hydrogen shell burning around an inert helium core.
