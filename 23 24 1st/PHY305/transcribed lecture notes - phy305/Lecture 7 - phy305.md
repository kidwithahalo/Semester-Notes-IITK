Let us first write down general physical properties of  sun.

Mass of Sun = $2 \times 10^{33} \text{ g}$
Radius of Sun = $7.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ cm}$
Sun to Earth Distance = $1.5 \times 10^{8} \text{ km} = \text{1 AU}$

Using all these properties we can calculate the mean density of the sun, 
$$\bar{\rho} = \frac{M_{\bigodot}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{\bigodot}^{3}}= 1.4 \text{ g} \text{ cm}^{-3}$$

Notice one thing the mean density of the sun is not very different from the density of water i.e $1 \text{ g} \text{ cm}^{-3}$

Does that mean that Sun's density of the Sun will behave similarly like water ? 
Now you have already understood the Sun has a surface temperature around $5800 \text{ K}$ and the centre of the Sun is some million of Kelvins. Hence the different part of the sun/stars behave differently and the aim for this lecture is to give you some idea how we actually come to know about the interior of the stars.

The de Broglie wavelength of a particle with momentum $p$ can be written as 
$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
$$\frac{1}{2} \mu_{m} v^{2}= \frac{p^2}{2 \mu_m}$$
