Let us first write down general physical properties of  sun.

Mass of Sun = $2 \times 10^{33} \text{ g}$
Radius of Sun = $7.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ cm}$
Sun to Earth Distance = $1.5 \times 10^{8} \text{ km} = \text{1 AU}$

Using all these properties we can calculate the mean density of the sun, 
$$\bar{\rho} = \frac{M_{\bigodot}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{\bigodot}^{3}}= 1.4 \text{ g} \text{ cm}^{-3}$$

Notice one thing the mean density of the sun is not very different from the density of water i.e $1 \text{ g} \text{ cm}^{-3}$

Does that mean that Sun's density of the Sun will behave similarly like water ? 
Now you have already understood the Sun has a surface temperature around $5800 \text{ K}$ and the centre of the Sun is some million of Kelvins. Hence the different part of the sun/stars behave differently and the aim for this lecture is to give you some idea how we actually come to know about the interior of the stars.

$$\frac{dP}{dr} = \frac{-GM(r)}{r^{2}}\rho (r)$$

$$E_{gr} = - \int_{0}^{R*} \frac{GM(r)dM(r)}{r}$$

$$\bar{P}V = \frac{2}{3}E_{\text{th}}^{\text{tot}}$$
$$E_{\text{th}} = \frac{-E_{\text{grav}}}{2}$$
