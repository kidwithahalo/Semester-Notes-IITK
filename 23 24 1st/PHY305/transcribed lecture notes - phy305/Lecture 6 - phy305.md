# <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">Binary Star and their Mass measurement</span>

A direct measurement of stellar mass is generally done by some binary (sometimes double or multiple star system). 
A significant of stars or member of binary system. Depending on different type of observations available, binary system are classified into various types. 

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Visual Binaries</span>
These are the system which can be resolved individually. They are seen to be orbiting their common centre of mass. Most of the cases, the separation between the members is so large that the orbital period is very large for human timescale.

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Astrometric Binaries</span>
The companion is too faint to be seen, but one of the other members shows minute periodic motion on the sky, while orbiting around the centre of mass.

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Eclipsing Binaries</span>
The orbital plane of a pair is inclined and up to the observers line of sight that each member periodically eclipses each other. They are also in general especially unresolved. They are usually resolved if the light from system has been monitored as a function of time. During each orbital period, the brightness of the system will undergo two dips. Each corresponds to the eclipses of one star by the door.
