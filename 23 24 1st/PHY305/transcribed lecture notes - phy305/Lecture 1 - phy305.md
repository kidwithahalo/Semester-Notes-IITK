#### <b style = "color:teal">Need for studying Astrophysics</b> ⟶ Why should be study it ?

1. <b style = "color:red">Human Curiosity</b>
From the dawn of human civilisation, we are curious ot know the what is happening in our surrounding. 
+ How are we here ? 
+ How the earth has formed, the sun has been formed (star formation) 
+ How our universe started ? 

This kind of questions always baffles humankind. Remember, if your curiosity is vanished you seem non-existent! 

Night sky with billions of starts and planet that everyone was wondering about gives birth to the astronomy. Astronomy is one of the most ancient science. Perhaps mathematics  and medicine considered to be as ancient as traditional astronomy. 

However, the birth of modern astrophyism is quite recent, which arose out of the union between astrophy and physics. It can be said to have been born in the middle of the nineteenth century.

> + #### <b style = "color:teal"><u>Let us discuss a bit about Ancient Astronomy</u></b>
Early human noticed that most stars did not seem to change their position with respect to each other. The seven stars of the great Bear occupy the same relative position night after night. But a handful star like object kept on changing their positions night after night and early greek kept on wondering about them – which are known as wanderers and now planets. They also noticed that there are  certain regularity in the movement of this planet. Building a model for planetary motion was the outstanding problem for ancient astronomy and many of you probably know that geocentric model was very much accepted before Copernicus (1543) came up with heliocentric model.

 > +  ##### <b style = "color:teal"><u>Geocentric Model</u></b>
 > Second Century BCE - Hipparchas - Plato (350 BCE)
 > Second Century AD - Ptolemy 
 > 
 > They have and comprehensive model of sun orbiting the planet i.e. geocentric model.
 > The Scientific Renaissance of Europe began with Copernicus, showing that heliocentric model provided a simpler explanation of the planetary motions than the geocentric model.
 > + ##### <b style = "color:teal"><u>Out of the box thinking is necessary</u></b>
 > Although the geocentric model where able to explain the motion of sun, this one posed somewhat a more difficult problem.

<b style = "color:red">Eudoxus</b>, student of Plato's suggest that an idea that planets occupied its own sphere and that all spheres we are connected through axis oriented at different angles and rotating at various speeds. This idea of complex sphere initially was successful but their production started to deviate when more observational data was obtained. Hipparchus also came by the theory of epicycle that planet rotating in epicycle orbiting on a larger deferent can explain this retrograde motion. But for next 200 years, the idea of planetary motion put forward by the Hipparchus became unsatisfactory and explaining many of the details observation. Ptolemy introduce refinement to the epicycles/deferent <span style = "color:red">still lacks the explanation of observation data. This process of fixing the existing theories let to an increasingly complex theoretical description of observable phenomena.  </span>

A sun-centered or Heliocentric model of Copernicus immediately solves many complex features found in planetary motion, which are given below: 
+ a) <span style = "color:teal"><u>Bringing order to the planet</u></span>
	+ Inferior Planets  - Mercury & Venus

	+ Superior Planets - Mars, Jupiter & others

   After Copernicus, the new physics developed by Galileo and Newton finally provided a dynamical theory of the planetary motion which can be used to calculate the orbits of planets around the sun. 

> ### <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">Important</span>
> Only very rarely does a branch of science reach a phase when the practitioners of that science feel that all the problems that branch of science had set out to solve have been adequately solved. With the development of Newtonian mechanics, planetary astronomy reached a kind of Finality. 
> Even the complicated techniques of calculating perturbations to planetary orbits due to larger planets got perfected by the 19th Century. Astronomers then turned their attention beyond the solar system. Telescopes also became sufficiently large by the middle of the 19th century to reveal some secrets of the stellar world to us.
> <br>
> Another incident that has changed our understanding of heavenly bodies is spectral lines. Fraunhofer observed the solar spectrum in 1817 and found some dark lines in the spectrum. In 1861, Bunsen and Kirchhoff understood that those dark lines resulted from the presence of different chemical elements present in the sun. This is the first direct observational evidence that the earth and other earthly bodies are made up of the same elements. This desiccation was the last nail in the coffin of the Aristotelian theory that the heavenly bodies are made of different materials than the earth and follow different physics.

<b style = "color:red">Newton</b> having shown that the planets obeyed the same laws of physics as any falling object at the earth's surface and the stars are made up of the same stuff as Earth (found by Kirchhoff & Bunsen), it has been clear that the laws of physics are universal, and consequently, the modern science of astrophysics was born.


	Note : 
		Nowadays, Astronomy and Astrophysics are used almost interchangeably. But Astrophysics is related to the observational part, and Astrophysics should be the theoretical part.

> Nowadays, we do astronomy in different ways, as you will learn in the next few lectures. Two ideas introduced in the ancient astronomy are still used. One is the constellation of celestial coordinates, and the other is the magnitude scale.

#### <span  style = "color:teal">Practical Implications</span>
Astrophysical system provided an opportunity to test extreme conditions of physical conditions for the laws of physics, which nevertheless was not possible to use in laboratory setup $\longrightarrow$ opened an unknown window which is very useful for physics application.

> 	Example 
>The interplanetary & interstellar made up is much more than the vacuum we can ever create on planet earth. The density interior to the neutron star is $10^{17} kg/m^3$  which is extremely difficult to create. 
>	One interesting thing where human being may surpass the nature is in creating low temperature than $273 \ K$ which is the temperature of $\text{cosmic background radiation}$

## <span  style = "color:red">Astrophysical Scales</span>
+ ### <b style = "color:teal">Unit of Mass</b>
	Astrophysics is the science dealing with stars, galaxies, and the entire universe, and we deal with large masses, distances, and time. Hence, daily to daily units of mass, time, and distance are not used. 
For astrological scenarios, the mass of the sun has to be used $M_0 = 1.99 \times 10^{30} \ Kg$

Although the intrinsic brightness and sizes of stars vary over several orders of magnitude, the masses of most star lies within a relatively narrow range from $0.1 M_0$ to $20M_0$.
Hence, it is very useful unit of stellar astrophysics. 
But sometime we need to deal with very massive system , like a typical galaxy ~ $10^{11}M_0$, mass of a globular cluster ~ $10^5 M_0$



+ ### <b style = "color:teal">Unit of Length</b>
	The average distance of the earth from the sun is called the astronomical unit (AU). It's value is <b style = "color:red">1 AU = $1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m</b>
	This unit is very useful for the stars within the solar system, but it's far too small to express the distance to stars and galaxies.
	For stars and galaxies, we use a distance called <b style = "color:red">Parsec</b> (denoted by pc)

> ### Parallax
> ![[parallax.png]] <center>Fig 3.8 from Pankaj Jain's</center>
> If we observe an object from a different position, we see it in different directions. The difference in the observed direction, or shift, in the angular position is called parallex. Due to the larger distance of the stars beyond our solar system, the observed parallax is very small but still measurable.
> <br> If $r$ is the distance of star, and $L$ is the distance moved the observer as shown in Fig 3.8 above
$$ \delta \theta =\frac{L}{r}$$

> Now when earth is orbiting the sun, the baseline can be taken as a distance between the sun and the earth.  Using context of Fig 3.8 again, 
> + Sun is at O. Hence, the distance between 1 $\rightarrow$ O  = 1 AU
> + Distance from O $\rightarrow$ Star = $d$ and angle subtended is 2$\theta$
 $$ \theta = \frac{1 \  AU}{d} $$
 > The parsec is the distance where the star has to be such so that it's parallax turns out to be $1''$
 $$ 1 '' = \frac{\pi}{180 \times 60 \times 60} $$
 > which can we further see as 
 $$ d = \frac{1 \ AU \times 180 \times 60 \times 60}{\pi} \approx 206265 \ AU \approx 3.26 \text{  light years}$$

> Proxima Centauri = 1.31 pc away = $3.09 \times10^{16}$ metres 
> 	$\Rightarrow$ One point to note is that with given precision, we can measure the distance up to 100 pc reasonable using the palrallx. We will revisit the concepts later.

+ ### <b style = "color:teal">Unit of Time</b>
	$$1 \text{ yr} = 3.16 \times 10^7 \text{ seconds} $$
	$$ 10^9 \text{ yr} = 1 \text{ Gyr or Giga-annum or billion years ago} $$
		<b style = "color:red">The importance of the order of magnitude calculations</b>
	> + #### <u>The magnitude Scale </u> <br>
	
	> 
	> Suppose we have two seires of lamp having 
	> intensities with $I_0, 2I_0, 3I_0, 4I_0,..$  
	> and other as $I_0, 2I_0, 4I_0, 6I_0,....$ and so on. 
	> <br> Eyes is much more sensitive to the geometric progression than the arithmetic way. 
	> The Greek astronomer Hipparchus compiles a list of position of some 850 stars. He assigned an apparent magnitude $m=1$ to the brightest star to $m=6$ for the faintest start based on the naked eye observation. 
	> Also, as our eyes are sensitive to the difference in logarithmic scale, this motivates a scale in which a difference of 1 magnitude between two stars results in a constant ratio between their brightness.
	> <br> A quantitative measure of such magnitude scale was proposed by Pogson (1856) by noting that the faintest star visible to the naked eye is actually 100 times fainter than the brightest star. Since these fainter and brightest stars differed by 5 magnitudes,  a difference of 1 magnitude corresponds to $(100)^{1/5}$
	> <br> Suppose $l_1, l_2$ are two apparent brightness for two stars , with their magnitude classes as $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. 
	> It is clear that
	$$ 
	\frac{l_2}{l_1} = (100)^{{\frac{1}{5}}(m_1 - m_2)}
	$$
    $$
    \begin{equation} 
    \tag{1}
	     m_1 - m_2 = 2.5 \log \frac{l_2}{l_1}  
    \end{equation}
  $$


	> These can be taken as the definition off apparent magnitude denoted by $m$
	 ---
	> + #### <u>The Absolute  Magnitude </u>
	> <br> The absolute magnitude of a Celestia object is defined as the magnitude it would have if it were palced at a distance of 10 pc.
	> <br> We can obtain the relation of absolute magnitude and the relative magnitude from Eq. 1 <br>
	> Suppose the star which is at distance $d$ and relative brightness is $m$
	> The brightness at 10pc for that object will follow an inverse square law. 
	> Hence, the ratio of brightness will be
	> $$ \frac{l_2}{l_1} = \left(\frac{d}{10} \right) ^2  $$
	> $$ \Rightarrow m - M = 2.5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{10} \right) ^2$$
	> $$ \Rightarrow m - M = 5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{10} \right)$$
	> In modern days, using sensitive detectors, astronomers, can measure the apparent magnitude of an object with an accuracy of $\pm 0.002$ magnitudes. Hipparchus's scale has been extended in both directions from $m = -26.83$ for the sun to approximately $m= 30$ for the faintest object detectable. 

The total range of nearly 57 magnitudes corresponds to over $(100)^{57/5} \approx 10^{23}$ for the ratio of apparent brightness of the sun to that of the faintest star or the galaxy yet to be observed. 

> <u>Note</u> that all magnitudes here are actually <b style = "color:red">bolometric</b> magnitudes measure over all wavelength of light. 
> + The _bolometric magnitude_ of a star is a measure of the total radiation of a star emitted across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. <br>

> +   In astronomy, the bolometric correction is the correction made to the absolute magnitude of an object in order to convert its visible magnitude to its bolometric magnitude. It is large for stars which radiate most of their energy outside of the visible range.
