In an accretion disks, the particles move on approximately circular orbits and lose energy and angular momentum due to viscous interaction with particles moving along orbits at adjacent radii. As a result the particles slowly drift to progressively smaller radii until reaching the surface of the star (or the Schwarzschild radius, if the accreted is a black hole).
The heat produced due to the viscous friction radiates away. 

This is a very active field of research and we understand general properties of this object. 

Consider a mass element $dM$ in the accretion disk around a star of mass $M$. To fall from a circular orbit $r + \Delta r$ to an orbit of radius $r$, the mass element should also lose some potential energy. Half of the lost potential energy is necessarily converted into additional $\text{K.E.}$ at the smaller radius with its higher Keplerian velocity and the remaining half will be converted to the heat. 
The gain in the thermal energy of the mass element will be 
$$\tag{gain in the $E_{thermal}$} dE_{th} = \frac{1}{2}\bigg(\frac{GMdM}{r} - \frac{GMdM}{(r + \Delta r)}\bigg)$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}GM \dot{M}\;  \frac{dr}{r^{2}}= 2 (2 \pi r )dr\; \sigma \; T^4$$
where, 
$\dot{M} = \text{accretion rate through a particluar annulus of the disk}$
$\sigma = \text{Stefan Boltzmann Constant}$

And the factor of 2 is assumed for two sides of the annulus area both top and bottom. 

From the above equation, we can find the temperature profile of the accretion disk.
$$T(r) = \bigg(\frac{GM \dot{M}}{8 \pi r}\bigg)^{\frac{1}{4}} r^{\frac{-3}{4}}$$ 

In a steady state , $\dot{M}$ must be independent of $r$ (otherwise material would pile up in the disk or there will be a shortage of material in the smaller radii) and must be equal to accretion rate reaching out to the stellar surface. 

Hence, $T \propto r^{-3/4}$ meaning that inner regions of the disk are the hottest one and it is from them most the luminosity emerges. 

The total luminosity of an accretion disk with inner and outer radii $r_i$ to $r_{out}$ is found by integrating from all annuli. 
$$L = \int_{r_{in}}^{r_{out}} 2 (2 \pi r) \sigma\; T^{4}(r)\;dr$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}G M \dot{M} \bigg(\frac{1}{r_{in}} - \frac{1}{r_{out}}\bigg)$$

This result in principle could have been also obtained from conservation of energy. 

If $r_{out} >> r_{in}$ , the result simplifies  further to 
$$L = \frac{1}{2} \frac{GM\dot{M}}{r_{in}}$$


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Radiative Efficiency</span>
We can calculate the radiative efficiency of accretion disk by dividing the luminosity above by $mc^2$ , then the hypothetical power that would be obtained if all the accreted  rest mass were converted to the energy. 
$$\eta = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM \dot{M}}{r_{in}}}{\dot{M}c^{2}}= \frac{GM}{2\;r_{in}\;c^2}$$

If the accretion object is $1.4 M_{\bigodot}$ neutron star then the accretion disk reaching  down to the stellar surface at the radius of 10  Km. 

$\therefore \; r_{in}$ is almost 2.5 times the Schwarzschild radius which is 3 km for a mass $1.4 M_{\bigodot}$

Hence the rest mass to radiative energy conversion efficiency is then about $0.10$

For blackhole accretors, it turns out to be $0.08$ from all general relativistic calculations.
