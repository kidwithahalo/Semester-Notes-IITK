So far we have discussed, the evolution of stars with initial masses less than 8$M_\bigodot$ which eventually ends up as white dwarf. How the stars with mass more than 8$M_\bigodot$ behaves would be discussed here. 

This evolution corresponds to spectral type '$\text{O}$' and early '$\text{B}$'

As we already discussed the stars are continually burning the nuclear fuel. After exhausting, most of the hydrogen in their cores such move to joint branch. Then they begin a sequence of steps, each consisting of the contraction and heating of the inner regions. Resulting in the ignition of new nuclear reactions. As time advances, shells at various inner radii attain the temperature and density required for the reactions that progressively produce heavier element.

We already discussed the nuclear reaction in low mass stars which are mentioned below
$$\ce{^{4}_{}He} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C} \longrightarrow \ce{^{16}_{}O} + \gamma$$
and 
$$\ce{^{4}_{}He} \; + \; \ce{^{16}_{}O}\longrightarrow \ce{^{20}_{}Ne} + \gamma$$

Apart from these, the massive stars can also burn carbon via the reactions
$$\ce{^{12}_{}C} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C}\longrightarrow \ce{^{20}_{}Ne} + \ce{^{4}_{}He}+ \gamma$$
and, 
$$\ce{^{12}_{}C} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C}\longrightarrow \ce{^{23}_{}Na} + p$$
and, 
$$\ce{^{12}_{}C} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C}\longrightarrow \ce{^{23}_{}Mg} + n$$

Carbon burning actually then followed by neon, oxygen and silicon burning. Each of these stages takes less and less time. 

For example, a massive star of mass 25$M_\bigodot$ , the duration of each burning stage are given below. 
$$H \longrightarrow 5 \times10^{6}\text{ years}$$
$$He \longrightarrow 5 \times10^{5}\text{ years}$$
$$C \longrightarrow 500\text{ years}$$
$$Ne \longrightarrow 1 \text{ years}$$
$$Si \longrightarrow 1\text{ day}$$

Massive stars undergo all the stages of nuclear burning up to the production of elements in the 'iron group' with atomic mass number around $A = 56$ consisting of isotopes of $\text{Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni}$

At this stage , star's outer envelope has expanded to about 1000$R_\bigodot$ and it has as dense core radius $\sim 10^{4}\text{ km}$ with onion like structure.

Remember outer layers of the core are still burning hydrogen. Looking inward, the core consist of concentric cells, composed, primarily of helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, silicon and iron, respectively

As we already know that energy can be gained by fusing or fissioning elements with low binding energy per nucleon into elements with high binding energy per nucleon. 

The iron group elements are the most tightly bound nuclei and are therefore a "dead end" in nuclear energy productions. Interestingly synthesis of iron group elements into heavier elements consumes rather than releasing thermal energy. 

When central iron core continues to grow and approaches $M_{ch}$, two process begins: 
1. Nuclear Photo-disintegration 
2. Neutronization


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Nuclear Photo-disintegration</span>
In this high temperature, the energetic photon or be abundant and they get absorbed in the endothermic nuclear reaction.
$$\gamma +  \ce{^{56}_{}Fe} \longrightarrow 13 \;\ce{^{4}_{}He} + 4n$$
with an energy consumption of $124 \text{ MeV}$. The helium nuclei are further unbound in the process. 
$$\gamma + 4\;  \ce{^{4}_{}He} \longrightarrow 2p + 2n$$ and in meantime consuming $28.3 \text{ MeV}$ (the binding energy of a $\ce{^{4}_{}He}$ nucleus)

Hence, the total energy of the star is reduced by  (124 + 13 x 28.3) / 56 MeV = 8.8 MeV per nucleon. With about $10^{57}$ protons in a Chandrasekhar mass, this corresponds to a total energy loss of $1.4 \times10^{52} \text{  erg} \approx 10$ times the energy radiated by our Sun in over $10 \text{ Gyr}$


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Neutronization</span>
The large densities in the core lead to a large increase in the rates of process such as 
$$\bar{e} + p \longrightarrow n + \nu_e$$
$$\bar{e} + \ce{^{56}_{}Fe} \longrightarrow \ce{^{56}_{}Mn} + \nu_e$$
$$\bar{e} + \ce{^{56}_{}Mn} \longrightarrow \ce{^{56}_{}Cr} + \nu_e$$

This nuetronization depletes the core of electrons and their supporting degeneracy pressure, as well as energy which is carried of by the neutrinos.

These two process leas in principle to an almost total loss of thermal pressure support and to unrestrained collapse of the core of a star on a free fall time scale. 

For the typical core-density prior to the collapse $\rho \sim 10^{9}\text{ g}\text{ cm}^{-3}$ (calculated from stellar evolution model), the time scale is 
$$\tau_{ff} = \Bigg(\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \bar{\rho}} \Bigg)\sim0.1 \text{ sec}$$

In practice, in this high densities, the mean free path for neutrinos become in the order of core-radius. This slows down the energy loss and hence collapse time to a few second. 

As the collapse proceeds and the density and the temp increases, the reaction
$$\bar{e} + p \longrightarrow n + \nu_e$$
and this reaction becomes very common and is infrequently offset by the inverse process of neutron decay 
$$n \longrightarrow p + \bar{e} + \bar{\nu_e}$$
leading to the equilibrium ratio of densities of 
$$n_{e}= n_{p}\approx \frac{1}{200}n_n$$

Hence most of the nucleons becomes neutrons and a neutron star forms , in which degenerated neutrons  rather than electrons, provide the pressure support against gravity.

Neutrons are also fermions and hence its radius could be calculated in the same way as the white dwarf by just replacing electrons mass with the neutron mass. 
Hence, 
$$r_{ns} = 2.3 \times 10^{9}\text{ cm} \frac{m_e}{m_{n}} \bigg(\frac{Z}{A}\bigg)^\frac{5}{3}\bigg(\frac{M}{M_{\bigodot}}\bigg)^{\frac{-1}{3}}$$
$$ \approx 14 \text{ km} \bigg(\frac{M}{1.4 M_{\bigodot}}\bigg)^{-1/3}$$

Here we have put $\frac{Z}{A} = 1$, and the reason being that the number
