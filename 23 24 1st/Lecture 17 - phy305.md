So far we have discussed, the evolution of stars with initial masses less than 8$M_\bigodot$ which eventually ends up as white dwarf. How the stars with mass more than 8$M_\bigodot$ behaves would be discussed here. 

This evolution corresponds to spectral type '$\text{O}$' and early '$\text{B}$'

As we already discussed the stars are continually burning the nuclear fuel. After exhausting, most of the hydrogen in their cores such move to joint branch. Then they begin a sequence of steps, each consisting of the contraction and heating of the inner regions. Resulting in the ignition of new nuclear reactions. As time advances, shells at various inner radii attain the temperature and density required for the reactions that progressively produce heavier element.

We already discussed the nuclear reaction in low mass stars which are mentioned below
$$\ce{^{4}_{}He} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C} \longrightarrow \ce{^{16}_{}O} + \gamma$$
and 
$$\ce{^{4}_{}He} \; + \; \ce{^{16}_{}O}\longrightarrow \ce{^{20}_{}Ne} + \gamma$$

Apart from these, the massive stars can also burn carbon via the reactions
$$\ce{^{12}_{}C} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C}\longrightarrow \ce{^{20}_{}Ne} + \ce{^{4}_{}He}+ \gamma$$
and, 
$$\ce{^{12}_{}C} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C}\longrightarrow \ce{^{23}_{}Na} + p$$
and, 
$$\ce{^{12}_{}C} \; + \; \ce{^{12}_{}C}\longrightarrow \ce{^{23}_{}Mg} + n$$

Carbon burning actually then followed by neon, oxygen and silicon burning. Each of these stages takes less and less time. 

For example, a massive star of mass 25$M_\bigodot$ , the duration of each burning stage are given below. 
$$H \longrightarrow 5 \times10^{6}\text{ years}$$
$$He \longrightarrow 5 \times10^{5}\text{ years}$$
$$C \longrightarrow 500\text{ years}$$
$$Ne \longrightarrow 1 \text{ years}$$
$$Si \longrightarrow 1\text{ day}$$

Massive stars undergo all the stages of nuclear burning up to the production of elements in the 'iron group' with atomic mass number around $A = 56$ consisting of isotopes of $\text{Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni}$

At this stage , star's outer envelope has expanded to about 1000$R_\bigodot$ and it has as dense core radius $\sim 10^{4}\text{ km}$ with onion like structure.

Remember outer layers of the core are still burning hydrogen. Looking inward, the core consist of concentric cells, composed, primarily of helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, silicon and iron, respectively
