##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Igneous rocks</span>
+ magma cools and crystallise into this rock
+ Hard , no layers
<br>
+ The rate at which the magma cools down to form these rocks can result in two types of rocks
	1. Intrusive 
		+ Slow magma Cooling . E.g Granite
	2. Extrusive
		+ Rapid magma cooling. E.g. Obsidian

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Sedimentary Rocks</span>
+ Forms from sediment compaction
+ Crumbly, layered
<br>
+ The way the rocks break can be further classified into two ways 
	1. Clastic - Compacted broken rocks. E.g Sandstone
	2. Chemical - Compacted dissolved materials. E.g Limestone

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Metamorphic rocks</span>
+ Formed by application of higher Temperature and Pressure on the already formed Igneous and Sedimentary Rocks
+ They are relatively hard, may or may not have layers. These can be divided into 
	1. Foliated - has layers. E.g Slate
	2. Non Foliated - have no layers. E.g. Marble
