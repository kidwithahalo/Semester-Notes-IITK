The gravity of Jupiter prevented a planet from forming in this region and hence maybe all those cluttered objects refuge in this region. 


## <span  style = "color:PaleGreen">Comets</span>
A relatively small and icy object that orbits a star. Comets display energetic jet activity when they come close to the Sun

Could asteroids be the comets which have lost the ice and dust and only the rocks remains.  But at same time, we call comets which are smaller and asteroids which are bigger in sizes. Does the argument soundly stands when we say comets are bound to eventually lose ice in their trajectory and what they become is we call asteroids.
