+ olivine + pyroxene forming the mantle of the moon
+ Plagioclase + anorthite forming the crust of the moon
+ Core was core and idk what it was


### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Monomineralic Crust $\rightarrow$ Crystallization of Minerals</span>

+ Mineral crystallization $\Longrightarrow$ Specific set of conditions
+ Unique character of mineral (composition & internal structure)
+ Gradual cooling $\Longrightarrow$ sequential crystallization of minerals
+ Density separation $\Longrightarrow$ formation of mineral layers


##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Crystallisation of Minerals - Bowen's Reaction Series </span>
[This excellent video explains the Bowen's reaction very clearly. I think I need not make the notes here. It will suffice to watch the video ](https://youtu.be/ZggKhS4hr_Y)
