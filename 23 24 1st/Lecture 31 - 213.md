- Large ice age floods happened around ~ 15, 000 years ago

    A[Ice Dam <br> <br> were created due to actions of earth and other agencies. They were rather sporadic and <br>not present eveywhere across globe. ] --> B[Water accumulation <br> <br>and later it is breached to form cracks leading into the flood later  ]
    B --> |how much of water column / ice thickness would <br> have been required to carry such <br> boulder to such massive distances ?????| C[Catastrophic floods<br><br> Giant pieces of rocks were transported very long distances in these floods]
    C --> D[Erosion of rocks in the path <br> <br>Various kinds of different rock profile are observed which suggests that these <br> rocks must have transported to here , rather than naturally being present]
    D --> E[Deposition]
```


> Depositional history can tell us about the nature of floods $\Longrightarrow$ We can study phenomena on other planets taking the analogy of the prior.

# <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">Transport History of Pebbles on Mars</span>
Martian basalt pebbles have been carried for tens of kilometre from their source, by bed-load transport on an alluvial fan.

In the figure above, 
- IR - circularity
- C - convexity
- b/a - axis ratio

1. Shape evolution of a single particle constantly colliding with a flat surface is described by 
$$\bbox[8px, border: 2px solid red] {\tag{Fickey's equation}v = c \times k}$$
where
- $v = \text{speed of abrasion}$
- $c = \text{constant}$
- $k = \text{local curvature}$
2. Rotating Drum experiment : Simulate transportation by tracking number of rotations
