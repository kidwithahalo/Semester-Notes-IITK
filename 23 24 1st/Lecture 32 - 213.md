Scale of Ice age floods
1. Melting of 700m thick ice sheets
2. Accumulated water : 3240 $km^3$
3. Peak Flow rate : $100 \times10^{6}\text{ m}^3/\text{second}$  ~ 35000 Niagra falls 


### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Landslides </span>
> Rapid displacement of a mass of rock, residual soil, or sediments adjoining a slope, in which the center of gravity of the moving mass advances in a downward and outward direction  (Terzaghi , 1950)

> A similar movement to that of a landslide , proceeding at an imperceptible rate is called 'creep'

Properties of Landslides 
1. Steep Scarp Face
2. Complex pattern of cracking in the upslope portion of the slide mass
3. Broad distal end
4. Bulbous (inflated) surfaces

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Relevance of Landslides</span>
- Represent mass movement at different rates and periodicity
- Caused by various geological processes as well as human activities 
- Fluid activity, Earthquakes (seismicity)
- loss of vegetation cover,
- overloading of terrain by man made infrastructure 
- Landslide may indicate geological activity
- represents resurfacing activity on planetary bodies
- causal reaction of crater impact, tidal flexing
