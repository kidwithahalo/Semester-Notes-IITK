#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Christiansen feature</span>
The Christiansen effect **occurs when a suspension of particles in a transparent medium is observed at a wavelength where the refractive indices of the particles and of the medium are equal**, thus producing an optically homogeneous medium with optical bandpass or filter characteristics.


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Restrahlen Bands</span>
The **reststrahlen effect** (German: “residual rays”) is a [reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") phenomenon in which [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") within a narrow energy band cannot propagate within a given medium due to a change in [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index") concurrent with the specific absorbance band of the medium in question; this narrow energy band is termed the _reststrahlen band_.
