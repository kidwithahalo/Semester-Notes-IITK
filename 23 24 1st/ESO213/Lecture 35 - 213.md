There can be various ways in which $\text{CO}_2$ can be pumped or ejected out of the atmosphere. 
1. Large scale processes i.e. volcanism can inject large amount of $\text{CO}_2$ in air. 
2.  $\text{CO}_2 \rightarrow \text{atmospheric warming} \rightarrow \text{more rain} \rightarrow \text{more weathering} \rightarrow \text{more} \text{ Ca}^{2+} \text{  by sea}$
   $\text{oraganisn by forming shells} \rightarrow \text{large carbon storage}$

- Residence time (RT) : The length of time for which a species resides in a given reservoir
- RT = $\frac{\text{Reservoir size}}{\text{material in or out }}$
- Carbon RT in Atmosphere = $\frac{750}{(110 + 90)} = 3.75 \text{ years}$
- Carbon RT in Deep oceans = $\frac{38000}{106} = 380 \text{ years}$

### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Residence Time between Different Reservoirs</span>
- Shorter Residence Time - Shorter duration of storage in a given reservoir
- Longer Residence Time - Reservoir storage for longer duration

- Calcite dissolution $\Longrightarrow$ $\text{pH}$ buffer increases ground water $\text{Ca}^{+2}$ concentrations
- $\text{Ca}^{+2}$ driven exchange reactions $\Longrightarrow$ increase in the concentration of major and trace metal cations
- Competitive adsorption of carbonate $\Longrightarrow$ release of anion from adsorption sites
- Dissolution of reactive $\text{Fe}$ concentration in ground water
- Increased pore pressure in sub-surface reservoirs $\Longrightarrow$ Earthquakes
- Oil well companies dumping waste water in deeper reservoirs $\Longrightarrow$  Seismic activity
- Reduction in waste water dumping $\Longrightarrow$  Reduction in seismic activity
-
