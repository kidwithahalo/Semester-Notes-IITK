+ $\text{CO}_2$ is an important weather agent. Can we artificially store $\text{CO}_2$  in the preferred reservoir ? And if we can, which reservoir can provide longest time  to store it ?

+ Physical weathering involves physical break up and transport of material.
+ Chemical weathering involves dissolution of the target rock and re-precipitation to form sedimentary rocks e.g. limestone

> In many cases, weathering reactions lead to an effective extraction of $\text{CO}_2$  from atmosphere and locking it in the ocean sediments
