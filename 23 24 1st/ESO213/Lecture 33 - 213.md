<u>Aeolian Landforms </u>
Aeolian landforms are feature produced by either the erosive or depositive action of the wind. These features may be built up from snow or sand, or eroded rock, snow or ice. 

Different kinds of landforms that are built upon agency of wind
1. Sand Dunes : 
	- Mounds of sand with wind direction aligned slope faces. Occur as clusters
2. Loess Deposits : 
	- Fine scale layered deposits 
3. Ventifacts : 
	-  Wind / Ice carved erosional feature. Polished, grooved, pitted
4. Yardangs : 
	-  Erosional remnants oriented along the wind directions 
5. Desert Pavements : 
	- A surface layer of closely packed, loosely cemented coarser fraction with wind having swept away the finer fraction
