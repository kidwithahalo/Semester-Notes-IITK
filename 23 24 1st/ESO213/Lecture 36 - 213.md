- Change in $\text{CO}_2$ in atmoshpere $\Longrightarrow$ Feedback on their processes 
- Strongly interlinked processes ( High $\text{CO}_2$ $\Longrightarrow$  warmer atmosphere $\Longrightarrow$ enhanced weathering)
- Major $\text{CO}_2$ reservoirs on Earth
- One of the largest reservoirs : Sedimentary rocks
- Residence time : Long / Short $\rightarrow$ implications for carbon sequestration
- Pumping $\text{CO}_2$ in empty hydrocarbons reservoirs
- Impacts on water quality
- Induced seismicity

## <span  style = "color:PaleGreen">landscapes created by the Wind</span>
- Sand movement
- Terrestrial Case : 
	1. Saltation : Bouncing on the ground (95%)
	2. Creep : Inter-particle collision leading to movement (4%)
	3. Suspension : Blowing in the air (1%)

### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Landscapes carved by Wind Deposition</span>
:: Various types ::
1. Parabolic 
	- Sand covered by vegetation, wind preferentially removes sand around, coastal area
2. Barchans
	- Stabilised by vegetation along arms, limited sand supply, wind in one direction, flat landscape
3. Longitudinal
	- Long duration wind blowing in the same direction, limited sand supply
4. Star Dunes 
	- Changing wind direction, alternating change in periodic fashion
