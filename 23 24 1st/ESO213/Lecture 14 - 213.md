### <span  style = "color:dodgerblue">Questions to track </span>
+ Which crystal system should exhibit higher degree of diversity in morphological forms?  
  >  My guess would go with cubic system because it is the most commonly found structure of the crystal around.
+ Learn the process of nucleation and how the minerals start to form from magma/lava

#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Crystal Form</span>
##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Prism</span>
An open form consisting of 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12 faces, all of which are parallel to the same axis.

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Pyramid</span>
An open form consisting of 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12 non-parallel faces that meet at a point.

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Dipyramid</span>
A closed form having 6, 8, 12, 16 or 24 faces. Faces meet at two points. Comprise of two pyramids, one formed by reflection along a horizontal mirror plane

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Trapezohedron</span>
A closed form with 6, 8 or 12 faces in all, with 3, 4 or 6 upper faces offset from 3, 4, or 6 lower faces

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Scalenohedron</span>
A closed form with 8 or 12 faces grouped in symmetrical pairs.

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Rhombohedron</span>
A closed form with 6 faces. 3 faces at the top alternate with 3 faces at the bottom.

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Disphenoid</span>
