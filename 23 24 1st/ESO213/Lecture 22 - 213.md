So far we have studied the the ratio of core and mantle in the previous slides. 


You already know about the pacific ring of fire


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Pluto: The Dwarf Planet</span>

<span  style = "color:Sienna">What is this Sputnik Planum on the surface of Pluto ? </span>
  
Sputnik Planitia, originally Sputnik Planum, is a high-albedo ice-covered basin on Pluto, about 1,050 by 800 km in size, named after Earth's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1.

Further, the new satellite that was sent to the surface revealed more about this elevated part of the pluto. The professor shared a photo in the slides about the suraface of Pluto where there were Nitrogen whirls like a eye of cyclone. The question was what was powering this power for air flow. 
New Horizons confirmed that Pluto's surface is rich in **nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane ices**. These compounds appear to be concentrated in this bright, craterless expanse, informally called Sputnik Planitia, that is probably the site of an enormous, ancient impact basin


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Europa: Jupiter’s Moon</span>
Might be suitable for the life there. 
Europa clipper is charged with responsibility to probe if the human life could be possible on the planet. It will commence its journey in 2024. 

- [ ] Europa report is the movie recommended by the professor.


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Mars: Activity of Flowing Water?</span>

- [ ] What is Recurring slope Linea ? 
	Recurring slope lineae (RSL) are **dark linear markings on Mars that regrow annually and likely originate from the flow of either liquid water or granular material**
	This is called in question as this process warrants the existence of water for it to happen. 


#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Titan: Saturn’s Largest Moon</span>
Titan has an earth like nitrogen rich atmosphere.

There are drainage channels on Titan which suggests that there was a flow of a fluid which carved those channels. 
Channel geometry can reveal properties of the sub-surface as well as fluid medium that has carved out the channels. 
Also there are hydrocarbons lakes on the North Pole of Titan. It rains methane and ethane on the surface of Titan.
