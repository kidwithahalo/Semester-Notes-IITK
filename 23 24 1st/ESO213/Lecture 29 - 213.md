Groundwater use needs to be regulated and monitored. Excess extraction may cause 
1. Drying up of aquifers (no infinite supply of groundwater)
2. subsidence of land
3. clogging of pore spaces in aquifer rendering them useless


### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Sinuous Feature on the Moon</span>
> Sinuous rilles are **long, winding valleys on the Moon that resemble river valleys on Earth**. They are thought to have formed as the result of lava erosion into the lunar surface



### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">Formation of Drainage Network on Titan</span>
- Liquid hydrocarbon rivers (methane, ethane) incising into icy substrate (hydrocarbons, water ice)
- Rate of incision  influences the formation 
- Target properties influencing drainage pattern



## <span  style = "color:PaleGreen">Drainage Network $\Longrightarrow$ Past Climate Evidence</span>

try to get some questions if you can
