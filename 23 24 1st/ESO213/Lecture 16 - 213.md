+ Industrial applications for crystal growth science (Barite in Oil Pipes)
  > Barite is used because _it is very dense (so you don't have use much), chemically inert (so_ it won't react with anything) and perhaps most importantly, cheap.
  
+ Healing (heat treatment) may reconstitute the structure. How and why ?

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Isomorphism and Polymorphism</span>
Isomorphism refers to the resemblance in the crystalline structures of two different compounds.
Polymorphism refers to the existence of distinct crystalline forms of the same compound.

 Isomorphic compounds have identical crystal shapes. 
 Polymorphic compounds have different crystal structures.
