+ ?? Highest density of lattice point in a crystal plane → lowest energy configuration 
+ Diversity in crystal morphology also a function of where the crystallization clock froze ?

+ So what are the factors that help the minerals get their shape and affects the growth process.

- [ ] Why does the growth happen more towards the corners than the planar faces ? 

## <span  style = "color:PaleGreen">Crystal Formation - Growth</span>

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Nucleation</span>
A net positive change happens and that shapes the growth of the mineral down the line

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen"> Surface area-to-volume ratio</span>
The change in surface area to volume will help in heating and cooling process which shapes the growth of minerals. 

- Affects ability to re-dissolve
- Influences growth rate

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Sites of energy loss</span>
There is a preferential growth along the corners of the minerals rather than the planar side. There is a proper explanation for this but I choose to skip it for now.  This results from the attempt to acquire stability.  For starters you can keep up with the fact that crystal growth minimizes energy, causing high energy faces to grow preferentially

The sequence goes as follows  $\Longrightarrow$ Corners > Edges > Faces

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen"> Energy differences</span>
After the nucleation process have started , the aggregation process is not uniform. At some packets inside the space, the mineral growth can be smooth and fast, while at other packet it can be a bit slow. This clearly gives the idea of energy differences inside the space
- Chemical character of the constituent species
- Geometry of the crystal

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Clumps/ Atom clusters act as growth points</span>
Well take this as a fact and move on brother. We will study it later sometimes 
+ Rate of growth determines prominent faces of a mineral
+ Rapidly growing faces disappear, literally growing themselves out of existence
+ Slowest growing faces are manifested in a crystal’s external morphology
