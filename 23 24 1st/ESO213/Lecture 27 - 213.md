The interaction with the fluid too can be very different. The way the basins (water bodies) carry matter carries solid with the fluids is interesting to study

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Reservoir of Water Beneath the Ground </span>
Factors influencing the water storage and extraction 
+ Porosity
+ Permeability

Types of reservoir
+ Unconfined aquifer 
	+ water can be stored and extracted
+ Confined aquifer
	+ water can be stored and extracted 
+ Aquitard
	+ water can be stored but can only be partially extracted
+ Aquiclude
	+ water can be stored but cannot be extracted
+ Aquifuge
	+ water cannot be stored and therefore no possibility of extraction

The above are sedimentary rocks.

- In left (L) is the chalk formation which have extensive fine grained chalk formations deposit in the deep, calm waters
- In the right (R) , is the limestone formation in the desert. It was a sea once. It was photographed in White Desert, Egypt. 



> Giant rocks on the beach are sometimes found. The reasons can be diverse. But the often found reason is subsurface volcanism and subsequent exposure.
