    A --> D(Radial)
    A --> E(Trellis)

The interaction with the fluid too can be very different. The way the basins (water bodies) carry matter carries solid with the fluids is interesting to study
```mermaid

    A[Water carries material in multiple models] --> B[Suspended <br> load ];
    A-->C[Dissolved <br> load];
    A-->D[Bed load];

##### <span  style = "color:SpringGreen">Reservoir of Water Beneath the Ground </span>
Factors influencing the water storage and extraction 
+ Porosity
+ Permeability

Types of reservoir
+ Unconfined aquifer 
	+ water can be stored and extracted
+ Confined aquifer
	+ water can be stored and extracted 
+ Aquitard
	+ water can be stored but can only be partially extracted
+ Aquiclude
	+ water can be stored but cannot be extracted
+ Aquifuge
	+ water cannot be stored and therefore no possibility of extraction
