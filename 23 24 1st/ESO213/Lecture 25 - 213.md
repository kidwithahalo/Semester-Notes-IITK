- Mantle convection drives plate tectonics. Molten hot core drives a convection in mantle. Core , crust and mantle are a coupled system. 
	- Slipping
	- Subduction
	- Collision 
	- Spreading

$$\Biggl \langle \text{Converge, Diverge, Transform} \Biggr \rangle$$


- Earth's land masses move toward and away from each other at an average rate of about **1.5 centimeters (0.6 inches) a year**. That's about the rate that human toenails grow!

+ - Eruption of diamonds during continental breakup. The Diamond which starts colourless, due to the factors involved in tectonic activities, the colour can be observed as pink, brown and orange tinted as the grade of distortions i.e. first stage distortion , second stage distortion. 
+ Ladakh Batholith – An igneous formation along the Indo-Asian Collision Zone
+ Plate tectonics may not be needed for origin of life But to maintain it... and along with that the question also arrises if some planetary body have life to start with...and it did not sustain due to Tectonics absence of plate tectonics?
