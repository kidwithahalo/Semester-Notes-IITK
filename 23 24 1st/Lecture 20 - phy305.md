#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Interstellar Medium (ISM)</span>
As the name suggests, the interstellar medium is the medium between the stars. 

If we consider the whole universe, most of the baryonic matter are distributed on the ISM and not inside stars. 

$\Longrightarrow$ Typically, $\text{ISM}$ consists of molecular, atomic and ionised gas with large ranges of densities and temperature  as well as solid particles of dust. 

> Most of the $\text{ISM}$ volume consists of atomic and ionised gas phases. However, molecular gas phases are particularly interesting as the new generation of stars can form in the molecular gas under some conditions. 

>The newly formed star after being born affects the surrounding medium by means of stellar outflows, photo-dissociation and photo-ionisation from the radiation of stars, shocks elements enrichment from the massive star core-collapse such as supernova explosions. 

- The $\text{ISM}$ hence releases this stellar energy by means of physical processes that are distinct from those we have seen in stars and stellar remnants. 

Talking about $\text{ISM}$ in star forming regions. 



#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">STAR FORMATION</span>
Stars are seen to form in molecular clouds

> What are these molecular clouds  ? 
> Molecular clouds are one component of the $\text{ISM}$ where the gas are in the molecular form. Basically they are agglomerations (randomly shaped) composed mainly of molecular hydrogen gas with typical mass of $10^{2}- 10^{5}M_{\bigodot}$, sizes of hundred of parsec and typical particle density of $10^{2}- 10^{4}\text{ cm}^{-3}$. 
> 
> The temperature are between $10 - 100 \text{ K}$

Molecular clouds are the largest, most massive, gravitationally bound object in the ISM. Although the densities of molecular clouds are the largest one can encounter in $\text{ISM}$, it is important to understand that these are rarefied compare to gas at an atmospheric density of $10^{19} \text{cm}^{-3}$

In fact, the densities of molecular clouds or mainly order of magnitude lower than the density of the best vacuum achievable in the lab.

One of the best studied and nearest to us is the giant Molecular clouds which are in the Orion star forming region at a distance of $500 \text{ pc}$

The mean density inside stars are typically $1 \text{g cm}^{-3}$ which gives a number density of $\sim 10^{24} \text{ cm}^{-3}$.
Hence, to form new stars, some reasons of the molecular cloud must be compressed by many orders of magnitude. We will study some general theory that how star formations can happen from the collapse of molecular clouds. 

### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">THE JEANS INSTABILITY</span>

Let us start with the spherical cloud with constant density and a temperature and composed of particles with mean mass $\bar{m}$ . 
Also, the gas is classical non-relativistic. 
$M = \text{mass of cloud}$
$r = \text{radius of the cloud}$
$\text{Gravitational energy} = |E_{gr}| = \frac{GM^2}{r}$

Now, let us allow the gas to go through compression radially $'dr'$. This will change the gravitational energy (it will become more negative - more gravitationally bound) by 
$$|d E_{gr}| = \frac{GM^2}{r^{2}}dr$$

Meanwhile, the volume of the gas will also change by 
$$dV = 4 \pi r^{2}dr$$
This corresponding to thermal energy enhancement which can be written as 
$$dE_{th} = PdV = 4 \pi r^{2} dr(nk_{B}T)$$
$$= \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}(\bar{m})}kT \; 4 \pi r^{2} dr$$
$$= \frac{3M}{\bar{m}}kT \frac{dr}{r}$$

As we studied inside the stars, the cloud will be unstable to gravitational collapse if the change in gravitational energy is greater than the thermal energy which provides the pressure support. 

The condition of instability would be 
$$|dE_{gr}| > dE_{th}$$
or, 
$$\frac{GM^{2}}{r^{2}}dr > \frac{3M}{\bar{m}}kT \; \frac{dr}{r}$$
$$\tag{1} M > \frac{3kT}{G\bar{m}}r$$

This gives the estimate of mass for a gas cloud of radius $r$ and the temperature $T$ for which the collapse will happen if the mass crosses the limit in above equation 1. 
This equation is known as ==Jeans Mass==
$$M_{J}= \frac{3kT}{G\bar{m}} r$$
Similarly a gas cloud will collapse if the radius of cloud with M is smaller than
$$r = \frac{G\bar{m}M}{3kT} = r_{J}$$
This condition can also be stated as a condition on the density which must be larger than the Jeans Density. 
$$\rho_{J}= \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3} \pi r_{J}^{3}} = \frac{3}{4 \pi M^{2}}\bigg(\frac{3kT}{G\bar{m}}\bigg)^3$$

Let us now calculate some numbers of Jeans parameters to get an idea how large/small these values are. Let us start it with molecular gas of mass $M \sim 1000 M_{\bigodot}$ and $T \sim 20K$

At these low temperature , most of the hydrogens are bound in the $H_2$ molecules $\Longrightarrow \bar{m} = 2m_H$. Therefore the Jeans density is 
$$\rho_{J} = \frac{3 \times[3 \times1.4 \times10^{-16}\times20]^3}{4 \pi (1000 \times 2 \times10^{33})^{2}\times[6.7 \times10^{-8} \times 2 \times1.7 \times 10^{-24}]^3}$$
$$= 3 \times10^{-24} \text{ g cm}^{-3}$$
which gives a number density
$$n_{J}(H_{2}) = \frac{\rho_{J}}{\bar{m}} = \frac{3 \times10^{-24}}{2 \times 1.7 \times 10^{-24}} \sim 1 \text{ cm}^{-3}$$

Hence, we found that the typical Jeans density of molecular cloud is order of magnitude smaller than the observed density ($10^{2}- 10^{4} \text{ cm}^{-3}$)

Therefore, according to our criterion that we have just formulated, our spherical cloud will be unstable and collapse. But the molecular clouds are observed for a very long time and they have been existing for a long time. To support their collapse, there will be some other kind of pressure. Currently it is believed that this molecular cloud are supported by pressure from turbulence and magnetic field. 

If the molecular clouds are gravitationally stable then how would they collapse and form stars ? What is going on ? 

Let us consider a one - solar mass dump of gas inside the big $1000 M_{\bigodot}$ gas cloud instead of considering full gas clouds with same temperature $T$.

The Jeans density for this $1 M_{\bigodot}$ cloud will be $10^6$ times larger.
$$\rho_{J} = 10^{6}\text{ cm}^{-3} \text{ for 1M}_{\bigodot} \text{ gas cloud.}$$
Now this cloud is much larger than the actual density of the cloud and it remains stable against gravitational collapse.

The collapse of a molecular cloud indeed starts at larger masses that more easily pass the Jeans criterion. As the collapse proceeds and the density increases, progressively smaller regions of the cloud reach the Jeans density for their mass and can start to collapse independently. This fragmentation into smaller and denser masses continues until the cluster of individual protostar has formed which eventually evolve into
