#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">Interstellar Medium (ISM)</span>
As the name suggests, the interstellar medium is the medium between the stars. 

If we consider the whole universe, most of the baryonic matter are distributed on the ISM and not inside stars. 

$\Longrightarrow$ Typically, $\text{ISM}$ consists of molecular, atomic and ionised gas with large ranges of densities and temperature  as well as solid particles of dust. 

> Most of the $\text{ISM}$ volume consists of atomic and ionised gas phases. However, molecular gas phases are particularly interesting as the new generation of stars can form in the molecular gas under some conditions. 

>The newly formed star after being born affects the surrounding medium by means of stellar outflows, photo-dissociation and photo-ionisation from the radiation of stars, shocks elements enrichment from the massive star core-collapse such as supernova explosions. 

- The $\text{ISM}$ hence releases this stellar energy by means of physical processes that are distinct from those we have seen in stars and stellar remnants. 

Talking about $\text{ISM}$ in star forming regions. 



#### <span  style = "color:Tomato">STAR FORMATION</span>
Stars are seen to form in molecular clouds

> What are these molecular clouds  ? 
> Molecular clouds are one component of the $\text{ISM}$ where the gas are in the molecular form. Basically they are agglomerations (randomly shaped) composed mainly of molecular hydrogen gas with typical mass of $10^{2}- 10^{5}M_{\bigodot}$, sizes of hundred of parsec and typical particle density of $10^{2}- 10^{4}\text{ cm}^{-3}$. 
> 
> The temperature are between $10 - 100 \text{ K}$

Molecular clouds are the largest, most massive, gravitationally bound object in the ISM. Although the densities of molecular clouds are the largest one can encounter in $\text{ISM}$, it is important to understand that these are rarefied compare to gas at an atmospheric density of $10^{19} \text{cm}^{-3}$

In fact, the densities of molecular clouds or mainly order of magnitude lower than the density of the best vacuum achievable in the lab.

One of the best studied and nearest to us is the giant Molecular clouds which are in the Orion star forming region at a distance of $500 \text{ pc}$

The mean density inside stars are typically $1 \text{g cm}^{-3}$ which gives a number density of $\sim 10^{24} \text{ cm}^{-3}$.
Hence, to form new stars, some reasons of the molecular cloud must be compressed by many orders of magnitude. We will study some general theory that how star formations can happen from the collapse of molecular clouds. 

### <span  style = "color:AquaMarine">THE JEANS INSTABILITY</span>

Let us start with the spherical cloud with constant density and a temperature and composed of particles with mean mass $\bar{m}$ . 
Also, the gas is classical non-relativistic. 
$M = \text{mass of cloud}$
$r = \text{radius of the cloud}$
$\text{Gravitational energy} = |E_{gr}| = \frac{GM^2}{r}$

Now, let us allow the gas to go through compression radially $'dr'$. This will change the gravitational energy (it will become more negative - more gravitationally bound) by 
$$|d E_{gr}| = \frac{GM^2}{r^{2}}dr$$
